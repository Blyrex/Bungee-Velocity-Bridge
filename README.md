# Velocity - Bungeecord - Bridge

## What is VBB?

**VBB** is a plugin for the well known Minecraft proxy [Velocity](https://github.com/VelocityPowered/Velocity). The goal
of the plugin is to create a way to use existing [Bungeecord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord/) plugins on
Velocity as well, so you don't miss out on Velocity's many features. Many server owners do not dare to change from
Bungeecord to Velocity because of the plugins, this worry is no longer necessary.

**VBB** implements all functions of Bungeecord for Velocity, even influencing events is possible!
